Create a simple, clean HTML website to showcase my projects. The design should be:
Style & Layout:

Minimalist and clean with plenty of white space
Mobile-responsive and works well on all screen sizes
Simple typography with a clear hierarchy (larger title, medium project names, smaller descriptions)
Centered content with comfortable reading width (not too wide)

Structure:

"Projects" heading
List of projects, each containing:

Project name (linked)
Brief one-line description below it


Simple, clean spacing between projects

Design Requirements:

No complex frameworks - just HTML and CSS
Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (like system fonts or Inter/Segoe UI)
Subtle hover effects on project links
Neutral color scheme (dark text on light background)
Links should be clearly clickable but not overly styled

Format:

Single HTML file with inline CSS
Each project should be easily clickable
Professional but approachable aesthetic

Please include placeholder text for 5-6 projects that I can easily replace with my own project names, URLs, and descriptions.
